            <p>Return <a href="index.html">Weight Analyzer Home</a></p>
            
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Weight Visualizer is designed with privacy at its core. We believe your health data should remain private and under your control. This privacy policy explains how Weight Visualizer handles your information.</p>

            <h2>Data We Access</h2>
            <p>Weight Visualizer requests read-only access to your weight data stored in Apple Health. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Weight measurements and timestamps</li>
                <li>This data is only read from Apple Health, never modified or deleted</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data We Don't Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                <li>No account creation or registration required</li>
                <li>No usage analytics or tracking</li>
                <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
                <li>No location data</li>
                <li>No device identifiers beyond what's required for basic app functionality</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
            <p>Your weight data is used exclusively within the app to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate interactive charts and visualizations</li>
                <li>Calculate statistics (averages, minimums, maximums, trends)</li>
                <li>Provide insights about your weight patterns over time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All processing happens locally on your device.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All weight data remains in Apple Health</li>
                <li>Weight Visualizer does not store your health data separately</li>
                <li>No data is transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li>No cloud storage or backup of your health information</li>
                <li>The app works completely offline after initial setup</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties. Your weight data never leaves your device except through Apple Health's own sharing mechanisms (which you control independently).</p>

            <h2>Demo Mode</h2>
            <p>Weight Visualizer includes a demo mode with simulated weight data for testing purposes. This sample data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is generated locally on your device</li>
                <li>Is not based on real user data</li>
                <li>Is deleted when you exit demo mode</li>
                <li>Is never transmitted or stored permanently</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Weight Visualizer does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Weight Visualizer does not knowingly collect or process data from children under 13. The app is intended for general audiences and relies on Apple Health, which has its own age restrictions.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
            <p>You maintain complete control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Revoke Weight Visualizer's access to Apple Health at any time through iPhone Settings > Privacy & Security > Health > Weight Visualizer</li>
                <li>Delete the app to remove all local app data</li>
                <li>Your weight data remains in Apple Health regardless of app installation status</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after policy updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

            <h2>Apple Health Integration</h2>
            <p>Weight Visualizer integrates with Apple Health in accordance with Apple's HealthKit framework policies. Apple Health data sharing is governed by your iOS privacy settings and Apple's own privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>Contact Information</h2>
            <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or Weight Visualizer's data practices, you can contact us through the App Store or at the support channels listed in the app.</p>

            <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
            <p>Where applicable under data protection laws, our legal basis for processing your weight data is your explicit consent, which you provide when granting the app access to Apple Health.</p>
