Today one of my friends decided to help me to make cookies after I failed so
surprisingly hard at making a cookie mix last week (turns out 300g is different
than 30g of water).

One interesting challenge to making cookies is that I do not have a scale or
measuring cup! Luckily, my friend and I had gone to a wine tasting where we got
to keep the wine tasting glass! So she used her own wine glass to measure the
weight of flour and sugar so that I could figure out the right amount to add.

I chose to make dark chocolate chip, macadamia nut cookies, with some sprinkled
in 3 chocolate chip mix (can you tell I love chocolate?).

Most of the cookies were made by mixing the dough with all the aforementioned
toppings in it. But a couple of them were separated and had a big chunk of
chocolate in the middle.

Needless to say the results were amazing!
