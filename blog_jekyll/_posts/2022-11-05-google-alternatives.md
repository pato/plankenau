Over the past eight years, I have been transitioning away from all Google
products and services, a change that occurred ever since I began to prioritize
privacy and express concerns about mass data collection for the purpose of
advertising sales.

This is a small post about which alternatives I use.

## Email (bye bye Gmail)

https://www.fastmail.com

This one was the toughest but one of the most rewarding. I have been a very
happy paying customer of Fastmail with a custom domain (you can see my example
contact mail in my [homepage](https://plankenau.com)).

## Search (bye bye Google search)

https://kagi.com 

## Analytics (bye bye Google Analytics)

https://www.goatcounter.com 

## Browser (bye bye Google Chrome)

https://browser.kagi.com

## Mobile (bye bye Android)

iPhone

## Hangouts/Allo/GChat

https://signal.org/en/

iMessage 

## Google Maps 

OSSMaps (through Pocket Earth)

Apple Maps 

## Google Calendar

Fastmail calendar

## Google domains
